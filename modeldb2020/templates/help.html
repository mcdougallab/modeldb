                                be downloaded to a previously choosen location (typically "Downloads" folder) or you will be asked to save the file in
                                a directory and, if you want, you can change the name of the file. Once the file is downloaded you can expand the zip
                                file with the unzip program that comes with your operating system (double clicking the zip file in windows explorer (mswin) or a finder window (mac)
                                will usually automatically invoke an unzip program). In general you will need to install a simulator or simulation environment. Links below provide
                                additional instructions for some simulators used by ModelDB models:</p>

                            </p><p class="indented">
                                Running models on your machine is inherently
                                insecure since models are able to execute any program or script
                                consistent with the permissions of the
                                user. We make a good faith effort at ModelDB to publicly provide
                                models that are associated with published papers and do not
                                knowingly provide models containing malicious or destructive
                                code, viruses, worms, etc.  We take several steps to ensure the
                                safety of running our publicly available models.
                                These include making a cursory examination
                                of each models code, test-running each model, and not
                                accepting anonymous models.
                                However if we were "hacked" our verified files
                                might be replaced with malicious ones.
                                Therefore please inform us if running a model
                                causes any kind of problem on your machine
                                so that we may remove the model as soon as possible from the database.

Possible errors include but are not limited to: logic errors, flipped signs, missing parentheses, etc. Note that every model is by definition an approximation, so missing ion channels, channels with the wrong kinetics, non-physiological parameter values are generally not considered modeling errors.</p>

                        <p>Many models have a "Model Views" tab at the top of their model description page. Click that tab, then select a figure under "Load Model Views". Two or more floating containers will appear, one with an expandable tree, the other(s) with graphical representations of the neuron(s). The tree may be expanded to see more information; e.g. on the view for "Figure 3" of <a href="/87284?tab=3">model 87284 (Morse et al., 2010)</a>, clicking "1 cell with morphology", "root soma", "18 inserted mechanisms", "kad (kadist.mod)", "gkabar" will show the distribution of A type potassium currents governed by the kinetics in kadist.mod.</p>
